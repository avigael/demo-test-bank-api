# Demo Test-Bank-API

This is a quick project using a this [API](https://github.com/avigael/test-bank-api "API"). I built this website to learn about Javascript and used Bootstrap for styling. I also learned how to work with my API so that it could be used on a website. I tested out different feature which allowed me to use Javascript to interact with my HTML and CSS. This was a great learning experience.

## Notes

I am hosting this API through Heroku's free services. So it may take 30s - 1min+ to start up the server.
